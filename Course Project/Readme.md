This contains code and report for course project for Adaptive Signal Processing.

The implementation is based on the paper: KERNEL-BASED IDENTIFICATION OF HAMMERSTEIN SYSTEMS
FOR NONLINEAR ACOUSTIC ECHO-CANCELLATION
link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6854300

The paper deals with identifying a hammerstein model using kernel methods. The adaptive part of the paper is based on only updating coefficients for linear part.

As an extra step, I have added my extension for time update of kernel coefficients(LMS and NLMS-like) as well and also implemented it in python
